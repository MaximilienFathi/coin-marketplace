# Coin Marketplace - A React.js Solution

Coin Marketplace is a website that keeps track of cryptocurrency and coin 
exchange performance. It also simulates trading transactions from one 
currency to another while still taking into consideration certain issues 
specific to real cryptocurrency trading.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View cryptocurrency current statistics
- View coin exchange current statistics
- Set specific cryptocurrencies as favorites
- Rank cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges by a specific metric
- Search and find specific cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges
- View current balance for specific cryptocurrency and recent amount change
- View specific cryptocurrency past and current performance
- Simulate a transaction from one currency to another with customizable settings
- Have access to specific cryptocurrency website, social networks, source 
  code, etc.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - JavaScript HTTP requests library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript UI library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - React component library
- [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/) - React charting library
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) - React routing library
- testing library?
- jest?

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The use of React as well as the more recent functional components and hooks
- The gain in HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge while creating many 
  React components from scratch
- The handling of routing with React projects involving multiple pages
- The use and customization of components from libraries like Material UI
- The use of UI design styles like glassmorphism to create beautiful websites
- The main blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related concepts

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this 
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the home page
- More pages such as one dedicated to blog posts
- A page for each coin exchange outlining their performance
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts
- A proper way of having real cryptocurrency transactions using Web3 
  technologies










## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
