## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View cryptocurrency current statistics.
- View coin exchange current statistics.
- Set specific cryptocurrencies as favorites.
- Rank cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges by a specific metric.
- Search and find specific cryptocurrencies and coin exchanges.
- View current balance for specific cryptocurrency and recent amount change.
- View specific cryptocurrency past and current performance.
- Simulate a transaction from one currency to another with customizable
  settings.
- Have access to specific cryptocurrency website, social networks, source
  code, etc.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - JavaScript HTTP requests library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript UI library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - React component library
- [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/) - React charting library
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) - React routing library
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JavaScript testing framework
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - Complementary testing library for React

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The use of React as well as the more recent functional components and hooks.
- The gain in HTML, CSS, JavaScript knowledge while creating many React components from scratch.
- The proper use of APIs using asynchronous code and the handling of potential related network errors such as error 429.
- The implementation of routing in React projects that involve multiple pages.
- The use and customization of components from libraries like Material UI.
- The application of UI design styles like glassmorphism to create beautiful websites.
- The main blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related concepts.

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- Some UI changes, particularly for the home page.
- More pages such as one dedicated to blog posts.
- A page for each coin exchange outlining their performance.
- A complete back-end mechanism with actual user accounts.
- A proper way of having real cryptocurrency transactions using Web3
  technologies.

### Useful resources

  great pictures to include in my project while still being similar in style
  as well as customizable (i.e. colors can be modified).
